# Evaluating B2B SaaS Moats: A Product Perspective

**Disclaimer: These are preliminary thoughts from observing an AI startup project, primarily from a product perspective. As someone still learning, my judgments may be immature. Feedback is welcome.**

## The Starting Point

Recently encountered an AI + multi-dimensional table startup project, focusing on "generating and managing multi-dimensional tables using natural language," positioned as a cross-platform tool.

After reading the business plan, my first reaction was: this project may lack a moat.

**Not because the team is bad, but because the track itself has issues.**

## Three Signals I Observed

### Signal 1: Major platforms could do this anytime

The product's core function is: natural language â†’ generate tables.

**For Feishu or Notion to add this feature, technically it's not difficult, might only take a few months. Or competitors with their own platforms could add "export to Feishu" functionality**


### Signal 2: "Cross-platform" might be a false need

The product's core selling point is: can be used across Feishu, Notion, DingTalk and other platforms.

But I asked several friends in enterprises, they all said: **Companies using Feishu are deeply bound to Feishu, those using Notion are deeply bound to Notion, there's rarely cross-platform management needs.**

### Signal 3: In the AI era, strong R&D capability remains a barrier

Rapid iteration, understanding AI's capability boundaries and business, decision-making judgment

## Three Questions for Judging Moats

Based on these observations, I tried to distill a simple judgment framework:

### Question 1: Why don't major platforms do it themselves?

**Good answers:**
- High technical barriers (like Figma's real-time collaboration engine)
- Compliance restrictions (like medical data platforms)
- Market too small, not worth doing (vertical industry tools)

**Dangerous answers:**
- "They haven't thought of it yet"
- "They move slowly"
- "We can seize the time window"

**If the answer is the latter, that's not a moat, that's a countdown.**

### Question 2: Is differentiation a feature or a barrier?

**Features: Can be copied easily**
- Cross-platform integration (technically not difficult)
- AI generation capability (calling APIs)
- Interface optimization (design issue)

**Barriers: Can't be copied or useless even if copied**
- Data loop (more user data = more accurate)
- Workflow lock-in (deeply embedded in business processes)
- Network effects (more users = more value)

**The differentiation this project lists are basically all features.**

### Question 3: Is the payment logic clear?

Looked at 3 payment models:
- One-time payment: Users try once might be enough, won't repurchase
- Subscription payment: When platform's own AI is free, why pay?
- Platform commission: No users, where's the ecosystem?

**Each layer has problems, meaning the business model might not stand.**

## A Simple Checklist

If you want to quickly evaluate a B2B SaaS project, ask:

- [ ] Will major platforms launch similar features within 6 months?
- [ ] Can differentiation be replicated within 3 months?
- [ ] Can the payment reason be explained in one sentence?
- [ ] Is the team rapidly validating assumptions, or making PPTs?

**If 2 or more answers are unfavorable, be cautious.**

## Some Immature Thoughts

As a product newbie, I might not see deep enough. But this observation made me realize:

**A startup project's moat is not "what we can do," but "why us."**

**Time windows are not moats.**
